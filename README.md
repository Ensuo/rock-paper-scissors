# rock-paper-scissors
Rock paper scissors program made with html, css and js

This project was given by the The Odin Project.
In this basic rock, paper, scissors game, you will be given three choices. After choosing one, the result will be displayed at the middle of the page, 
possibly being a win, a loss or a draw, and the points of each player will also be updated. The game is over after a player (either you or the computer)
obtains 5 points.
